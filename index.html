  <p id="slogan">For those who can't even meal</p>
  <p>You're so busy. You're trying to dominate the board room, find time to sweat, try not to be a stranger to your friends, go out, stay in and not lose your mind in the process.  Grabbing fast food and wasting money on some mediocre grub can just add to the frustration and not to mention your waistline. Busy B wants to B your concierge and deliver uncomplicated, awesome (healthy!) meals to your door that don't require Beyonce's bank account to finalize the transaction.</p>
